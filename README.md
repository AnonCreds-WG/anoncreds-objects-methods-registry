This repository contains the source documents for the [AnonCreds Methods
Registry](https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-methods-registry).
The registry is referenced in the [AnonCreds
Specification](https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/). AnonCreds
Methods are ways of registering and resolving AnonCreds objects on
specific Verifiable Data Registries (VDRs).

This repository and the registry are managed by the AnonCreds Specification Working Group. For more
details on the Working Group, see the ReadMe of the [AnonCreds Specification source repository](https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-spec).
