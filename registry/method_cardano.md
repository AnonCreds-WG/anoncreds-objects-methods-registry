### Cardano AnonCreds Method

The Cardano AnonCreds method specifies how to register and resolve AnonCreds objects as general purpose resources on  [Cardano Blockchain](https://cardano.org). The identifiers used for Anoncreds Objects follow the [DID-Linked Resources Specification](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/DID-Linked+Resources+Specification) defined at the Utility Foundry Working Group at Trust Over IP ([ToIP](https://trustoverip.org)).

This method is an effort from a collaborative working group with base on the Cardano SSI Alliance (CSSIA), and it's composed by the [Cardano Anoncreds Method specification](https://github.com/roots-id/cardano-anoncreds/blob/main/cardano-anoncred-methods.md) and two reference implementations: [python](https://github.com/roots-id/cardano-anoncreds/tree/main/reference-implementations/py) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/roots-id/cardano-anoncreds/tree/main/reference-implementations/ts).
