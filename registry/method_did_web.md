### did:web AnonCreds Method

This method defines a common way of referencing and resolving AnonCreds objects
based on the security provided by [did:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/)
specification, where resources can be stored and accessed by simply using web servers 
and traditional databases.

It inherits the same advantages and drawbacks from did:web, such as the simplicity 
(which might be useful to encourage the adoption of AnonCreds) and the lack of 
decentralisation that a blockchain or DLT-based method can provide.

It does not enforce any particular API or implementation for object creation or 
storage, other than a few measures to ensure object immutability.
