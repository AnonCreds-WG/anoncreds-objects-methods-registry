## Governance

This registry is managed by the AnonCreds Working Group. In turn, the AnonCreds
Working Group has delegated the Editors (also knowns as Committers, Maintainers)
of this registry to ensure it is maintained in an effective, transparent and
fair manner.

### Repository Content

There are two types of content in the source repository for the registry:

- The entries in the [AnonCreds Objects Methods Registry](#registry).
  - The content of the entries are managed by the implementers of the AnonCreds
    Objects methods.
  - The format of the entries MUST adhere to the guidelines defined in the
    [Method
    Template](https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-objects-methods-registry/registry/method_template.md).
- All other content in this document and [registry
  repository](https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-objects-methods-registry)
  - Such content is managed by the AnonCreds Specification Working Group, and
    includes things like this Governance section of the document, the format of
    the method entries, and so on.
    - Anything about the management of this document may be changed through an
      update to this type of content.

### Pull Request Handling

known as committers, maintainers) the authority to merge pull requests of either
type of content as follows:

- Based on an explicit vote of the AnonCreds Specification Working Group to merge the pull request; or
- When the change is simple editorial update that improves the content of any type; or
- When the pull request is to add or update a Registry method entry, and
  - the entry adheres to the registry entry guidelines, and
  - the links in the registry entries resolve to relevant content (e.g. the specification of the method), and
  - there is some evidence that the submitter is related or sufficiently familiar with the work being done on the method.

known as committers, maintainers) the authority to cancel pull requests of
either type of content as follows:
