## Registry

This section summarizes the AnonCreds methods currently in available.
The links and status are updated by their respective implementers as they
evolved, as per the [registry governance rules](#governance).

The normative requirements for AnonCreds method specifications can be
found in the [AnonCreds
Specification](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/). AnonCreds
methods that do not meet the guidelines as outlined in the [method entry
template](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-methods-registry)
will not be accepted.
