### did:prism AnonCreds Method

The `did:prism` AnonCreds Method specifies how to register and resolve AnonCreds objects as general purpose resources through the [PRISM DID Method](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/blob/main/w3c-spec/PRISM-method.md). The identifiers for the resources are DID URLs that are dereferenced to return the AnonCreds objects.

This method is defined upon the PRISM DID Method, however, it can be implemented on top of any DID method that supports [services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).
